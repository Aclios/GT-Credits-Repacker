# GT-Credits-Repacker
A (very specific) tool allowing to modify Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective scrolling credits, for the HD version.

# Usage
First, put the .gui file containing credits (natives\xxx\gui\ui010700\ui010700\ui010700.gui.520034) in the same folder as the tool, and run extract.bat to generate a credits.txt containing the text of the credits. 

Then, modify those credits as you want, and use repack.bat to generate a ui010700.gui.520034.new file which will contain your modifications.

Note: this tool will only work for this particular .gui file, and requires the unmodified gui file to extract and repack the credits.
